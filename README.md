# lichess-uci-bot
A bridge between [Lichess API](https://lichess.org/api#tag/Chess-Bot) and UCI bots.


## How to Install
- Download the repo into lichess-uci-bot directory
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Create your config file wih `cp config.yml.default config.yml`
- Remove the variants: `supported_variants` and time controls: `supported_tc` from the config.yml as necessary


## Lichess OAuth
- Create an account for your bot on [Lichess.org](https://lichess.org/signup)
- NOTE: If you have previously played games on an existing account, you will not be able to use it as a bot account
- Once your account has been created and you are logged in, [create a personal OAuth2 token](https://lichess.org/account/oauth/token) with the "Play bot moves" selected and add a description
- A `token` e.g. `Xb0ddNrLabc0lGK2` will be displayed. Store this in `config.yml` as the `token` field
- NOTE: You won't see this token again on Lichess.


## Setup Engine
- Place your engine(s) in the `engines` directory
- In `config.yml`, enter the binary name as the `engine` field
- Leave the `weights` field empty or see LeelaChessZero section for Neural Nets


## Lichess Upgrade to Bot Account
**WARNING** This is irreversible. [Read more about upgrading to bot account](https://lichess.org/api#operation/botAccountUpgrade).
- run `python main.py -u`


## LeelaChessZero
- Download the weights for the id you want to play from here: http://lczero.org/networks
- Extract the weights from the zip archive and rename it to `latest.txt`
- Download the lczero binary from here: https://github.com/glinscott/leela-chess/releases
- Copy both the files into the `engines` directory
- Change the `engine` and `weights` keys in config.yml to `lczero` and `latest.txt`
